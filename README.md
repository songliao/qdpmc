# Monte Carlo Method for Option Pricing

This is a package for pricing
path-dependent options using Monte Carlo Simulation
under Black-Scholes market dynamics.

This package relies heavily on **NumPy** for the implementation
of *vectorization*, which significantly boosts algorithm
speed. It also uses **joblib** to implement parallel computation.

this project is discontinued
